24/05/24, 22:54 - Aaryaa Ranade: Pretty flexible considering I don't write a lot
24/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: okay cool
24/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: I have an idea
24/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: I'll write it from the perspective of a guy
24/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: you write it according to a girl
24/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: and they both think that their love is unrequited
24/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: when in reality either of them is too scared to say it out loud
24/05/24, 22:55 - Aaryaa Ranade: Omg yes
24/05/24, 22:55 - Aaryaa Ranade: UR SUCH A GENUIS
24/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: and then it just fades away and nothing happens
24/05/24, 22:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Cuz they both think that the other doesn't like them
24/05/24, 22:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Holy shit

24/05/24, 23:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: But yeah I think it should be a part of the 3rd stanza

24/05/24, 23:21 - Ayush: instead of this lovey dovey stuff
24/05/24, 23:21 - Ayush: I wrote some but I'm not feeling it
24/05/24, 23:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Haina exactly
24/05/24, 23:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Like I keep writing and rewriteing it
24/05/24, 23:22 - Ayush: I'm writing but it's not coming from me
24/05/24, 23:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Like my train of thought is more like a roomba. Keeps ending weirdly
24/05/24, 23:22 - Ayush: because I pulled all the chicks i liked😔
24/05/24, 23:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ha vohi. Like morning mai I was super inspired. And very relatable shit that
24/05/24, 23:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: Dayum lucky guy

24/05/24, 23:24 - Ayush: only when I feel like it
24/05/24, 23:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ha exactly. Like I could write it in 10 mins
24/05/24, 23:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Makes sense
24/05/24, 23:24 - Ayush: you're crazy until u pull a girl then you're just 'lucky'
24/05/24, 23:24 - Ayush: um
24/05/24, 23:24 - Ayush: maybe idk
24/05/24, 23:25 - Ayush: I still take a lot of time
24/05/24, 23:25 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wouldn't know. Unfortunately haven't had the privilege of pulling a girl
24/05/24, 23:25 - Ayush: But that's because I'm very selective with my choice of words
24/05/24, 23:25 - Ayush: pls play from just one team
24/05/24, 23:26 - Ayush: <Media omitted>

25/05/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Uve raised the standards too much. Need u to genuinely give me starts now. (I have a new star shape ka obsession)
25/05/24, 01:08 - Ayush: when there is will there is a way
25/05/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: So ur gonna molest an unborn child
25/05/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Seems fair
25/05/24, 01:08 - Ayush: no way I'll lick a booty hole
25/05/24, 01:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Murder
25/05/24, 01:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not even a girl's?
25/05/24, 01:09 - Ayush: I will give u those star stickers that the teacher stuck on our notebooks
25/05/24, 01:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Pussy still gross
25/05/24, 01:10 - Ayush: but babe I'm doing it for us😔
25/05/24, 01:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Those are for praise kinks only
25/05/24, 01:10 - Ayush: If I have to
25/05/24, 01:10 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's ur own selfish reasons. Stop lying. We all know u love single digits 😭
25/05/24, 01:10 - Ayush: I don't know, I find it gross
25/05/24, 01:11 - Ayush: no pussy is fine

25/05/24, 01:11 - Ayush: yea I didn't have one
25/05/24, 01:11 - Ayush: do u
25/05/24, 01:12 - Ayush: don't attack me like that, listen to me it's for us.
25/05/24, 01:12 - Ayush: do u want to live ur life knowing you could show ur man a diluted rainbow but didn't
25/05/24, 01:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: Find that hard to believe
25/05/24, 01:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Maybe?
25/05/24, 01:13 - Ayush: no but u obviously either lick the clit or the vagina no
25/05/24, 01:13 - Ayush: u pee from the middle somewhere
25/05/24, 01:14 - Ayush: top middle I'm guessing
25/05/24, 01:14 - Aaryaa Ranade: Actually. Yes. Cuz I'd get to see it. And then I'd forever be able to tease u about it
25/05/24, 01:14 - Ayush: noted
25/05/24, 01:14 - Aaryaa Ranade: Tell me u don't know anatomy without telling me
25/05/24, 01:15 - Ayush: That's not fair. I will never be able to trust another woman again.
25/05/24, 01:15 - Ayush: 😭😭 Smita mam never showed me
25/05/24, 01:15 - Aaryaa Ranade: The surface area is pretty limited. So u end up licking all of it. It's more pleasure if the clit is stimulated
25/05/24, 01:15 - Aaryaa Ranade: Who Smita????
25/05/24, 01:15 - Ayush: Gore
25/05/24, 01:16 - Ayush: Yea and clit is on the starting point of the lip
25/05/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh achha. Tell me ur taking about a bio chart and not literally
25/05/24, 01:16 - Ayush: a bit below that is the urethra
25/05/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's the point.
25/05/24, 01:16 - Ayush: and then the grand canyon
25/05/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not exactly. But yeah close enough

25/05/24, 01:17 - Ayush: Eh I'll take that
25/05/24, 01:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ooh pro tip. While eating her out. Better if ur fingering her and then licking at the same time. Pleasure 📈📈

29/05/24, 11:40 - Ayush: It is a brag.
29/05/24, 11:41 - Ayush: Ofcourse. And I don't think we'll even need a third person to keep us entertained
29/05/24, 11:41 - Ayush: Obviously?
29/05/24, 11:42 - Ayush: yes yes I won't

29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Also we're entertaining sober. Imagine how entertaining we'll be when we're drunk
29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope
29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why??
29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Am I ur best friend???
29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Omg lucky u. No shower
29/05/24, 11:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's prolly what ur most excited about
29/05/24, 11:56 - Ayush: Resorting to emotional blackmail huh
29/05/24, 11:56 - Ayush: my dictionary will be like Marcus Aurelius's book tho
29/05/24, 11:56 - Ayush: ppl will get to see how great I was when I am dead
29/05/24, 11:57 - Ayush: 🤭🤭 I've never been drunk so it'll be fun
29/05/24, 11:57 - Ayush: exactly. and it's gonna be hard to get someone to match our vibe.
29/05/24, 11:58 - Ayush: idk we became close itna jaldi it almost seems superficial but it's not
29/05/24, 11:59 - Ayush: yes u are
29/05/24, 11:59 - Ayush: You know me so well
29/05/24, 12:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's the last resort. But yes. Girls gotta do what girls gotta do
29/05/24, 12:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay yeah fair. But. Whats the point in being famous after ur dead
29/05/24, 12:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Assuming ull accidently be famous
29/05/24, 12:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hainaa same. Maybe slightly tipsy. But that's it. No hangovers or anything
29/05/24, 12:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. They'll prolly be scared of 2 weirdos. Which is understandable. But jokes on them we're fun
29/05/24, 12:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hainaa. But I think it's cuz we have technically known each other for longer.
29/05/24, 12:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't feel awkward with u. Like I can say weird shit or sad shit. Ur there
29/05/24, 12:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: YAYAYAYAYYY 🥰
29/05/24, 12:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ofc. It's me. Also ur predictable
29/05/24, 12:49 - Ayush: I don't think it's limited to girls😭
29/05/24, 12:50 - Ayush: there is not
29/05/24, 12:50 - Ayush: Oh I can be famous, it's not that hard to be famous
29/05/24, 12:50 - Ayush: I choose not to be.
29/05/24, 12:51 - Ayush: Yeaaa same idk if I can't digest alcohol or if I haven't drank enough
29/05/24, 12:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: In this case it is. Because I identify as a female
29/05/24, 12:51 - Ayush: Ofcourse also there's only one weirdo
29/05/24, 12:52 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. Fir kyu? For shits and giggles. Uk what that's fair
29/05/24, 12:52 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh that's debatable but okay. What are u gonna do? O.f.?
29/05/24, 12:52 - Ayush: Yea I think that definitely helps because initially we had something to talk about
29/05/24, 12:52 - Ayush: By something I mean bitching about tanisha
29/05/24, 12:52 - Aaryaa Ranade: Uhuh okay sure.
29/05/24, 12:53 - Ayush: yeaa we're way past the awkwardity AND I SAID THAT LONG AGO
29/05/24, 12:53 - Aaryaa Ranade: I think it might be both. I just have a high tolerance. Don't get drunk. Maybe cuz I haven't properly drank drank
29/05/24, 12:53 - Ayush: 🫵🫶🫶
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: to tell u the truth I did shower today
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: the plan was cancelled
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: after I showered
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: Which is sadder than showering on normal days
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: "I'm predictable"
29/05/24, 12:54 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. 2 drunk weirdos. Cang make me change my mind
29/05/24, 12:54 - Ayush: I guess my life is not
29/05/24, 12:55 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmfaoo. That bitch deserves to be bitched about. Such an asshole.

29/05/24, 12:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ull get cancelled for that
29/05/24, 12:56 - Ayush: If heaven does exist and I can watch shit on earth it'll be sm fun that my book filled with weird words is used as a new language
29/05/24, 12:57 - Ayush: nope only fans never, idk I haven't figured it out but come on

29/05/24, 12:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay but they also make a shit ton of money. I'd rather be rich and be personality less. Than being broke and full of personality

29/05/24, 17:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Idk. U can if u want to. I was just saying 🤷🏻‍♀️
29/05/24, 17:50 - Ayush: sometimes I feel like feeling things. On bad days I feel a lot of feelings.
29/05/24, 17:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: So u say it in ur mind. Just not irl
29/05/24, 17:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: Mysoginistic ass
29/05/24, 17:51 - Ayush: no u just want reassurance
29/05/24, 17:51 - Ayush: you know me🤷‍♂️
29/05/24, 17:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why do u look like Mr. Potato head from 'toys'
29/05/24, 17:51 - Ayush: that's toxic
29/05/24, 17:52 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay fine. I'm not. But I'm gonna use it just to annoy u
29/05/24, 17:52 - Ayush: haaa I didn't expect anything hard in humanities
29/05/24, 17:52 - Ayush: no u are but you still don't know
29/05/24, 17:53 - Aaryaa Ranade: I mean atleast ur feelings feelings. I put everything in a box and don't think about it. That bites me in the ass
29/05/24, 17:53 - Ayush: u could simply say yes instead of
29/05/24, 17:53 - Ayush: this roundabout sentence
29/05/24, 17:54 - Ayush: I always say it in my mind. Too bad you're there to hear it😔
29/05/24, 17:54 - Ayush: no I love women
29/05/24, 17:55 - Ayush: hah I wish I had the ability to grow a moustache
29/05/24, 17:55 - Ayush: u can't do that. legally, morally and just human decency in general.
29/05/24, 17:56 - Ayush: yea even I bottle it up until I cant then I explode
29/05/24, 17:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why would I want reassurance when u brought it up?
29/05/24, 17:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay and???
29/05/24, 17:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ayo stfu. There was eco. Shit was complicated
29/05/24, 17:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: How would I not know if I was a stalker
29/05/24, 17:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nah. Whats the fun in that. Plus it hides the entire truth
29/05/24, 17:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's not helping ayush 😭
29/05/24, 17:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: Being mysoginistic and loving women has nothing in common
29/05/24, 17:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmao. Please don't. U look better as a twink than as a pedo potato
29/05/24, 18:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: Watch me. U think I give a shit about legality and morals??
29/05/24, 18:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. U just never visit it again. And then that just annoys u. And then u think of one thing which makes u slightly mad and then ur making a big deal out of it
29/05/24, 18:39 - Ayush: I forgot what we were talking about
29/05/24, 18:40 - Ayush: But pretty sure u are at fault
29/05/24, 18:40 - Ayush: I don't think I can do this anymore 😔
29/05/24, 18:40 - Ayush: don't even compare. don't get me started.
29/05/24, 18:41 - Ayush: ugh how dumb are you
29/05/24, 18:41 - Ayush: I meant you're a stalker but u still don't know about my friends
29/05/24, 18:41 - Ayush: how to cheat without cheating 101
29/05/24, 18:42 - Ayush: 😭😭 I tried just unhear and unremember it
29/05/24, 18:42 - Ayush: are u stupid
29/05/24, 18:42 - Ayush: Misogyny is hatred towards women.
29/05/24, 18:43 - Ayush: What did u just call me bitch
29/05/24, 18:44 - Ayush: things u can say to ur best friend but not in a day care
29/05/24, 18:44 - Ayush: itna sach nahi bolna tha🥺
29/05/24, 18:44 - Ayush: no psychology book will teach u that
29/05/24, 20:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Who's the goldfish now
29/05/24, 20:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: We were talking about how u can't go without talking to me
29/05/24, 20:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. Still on u
29/05/24, 20:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: This is how u decide to break it off with me??? 😭
29/05/24, 20:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: U chose that shit okay. Not my fault. It was complicated

29/05/24, 20:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Still cheating 😔
29/05/24, 20:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: I can't. U gave me trauma now. I'm never trusting another man
29/05/24, 20:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Dumbass. It's not hatred. It's prejudice against women.
29/05/24, 20:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: I called u a twink. Whatchya gonna do about it
29/05/24, 20:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmfaooo 💀😭
29/05/24, 20:39 - Aaryaa Ranade: Thoda jyada hi trauma nikala lmao
29/05/24, 20:39 - Aaryaa Ranade: Psychology book was pretty useless. Pehle se hi sab pata tha
29/05/24, 22:49 - Ayush: It has always been me💀
29/05/24, 22:50 - Ayush: Ohhhh
29/05/24, 22:50 - Ayush: I think I'll only know once we stop
29/05/24, 22:50 - Ayush: which I don't think we will anytime soon
29/05/24, 22:50 - Ayush: unless yk u find even cooler and funnier friends
29/05/24, 22:51 - Ayush: but let's be real the chances are slim
29/05/24, 22:51 - Ayush: nuh uh never.
29/05/24, 22:52 - Ayush: nooo it's so anticlimactic
29/05/24, 22:52 - Ayush: there should atleast be thunder in the background with heavy rain
29/05/24, 22:52 - Ayush: and I leave u stranded and ask u to go home on ur home
29/05/24, 22:52 - Ayush: but I do hope that day will never come
29/05/24, 22:53 - Ayush: yes I did. I think I'll earn more than you. So please.
29/05/24, 22:53 - Ayush: u took years to get that the essence is gone now
29/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: "I don't condone cheating"
29/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: Good. Are you breaking up?? Asking for a friend.
29/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: Prejudice is a feeling of strong dislikeness
29/05/24, 22:54 - Ayush: so = hatred
29/05/24, 22:55 - Ayush: I will choke you and not in a sexual way.
29/05/24, 22:56 - Ayush: koi na mera bhi trauma dump aayega ek din
29/05/24, 22:56 - Ayush: humanities is useless in general
29/05/24, 23:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmfaoo facts

29/05/24, 23:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's super entertaining
29/05/24, 23:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Plus it's a part of ur routine and studies have proven that humans cannot go without following a set of things throughout the day. So it's def gonna be hard for u
29/05/24, 23:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: So ur just gonna leave me there. Stranded. As my tears mix with the rainwater falling down my face
29/05/24, 23:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not even looking back at me.
29/05/24, 23:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Making me wonder if I'll ever find closer, if my heart can't ever heal
29/05/24, 23:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: That was pretty poetic ngl. We need to write the fucking poem together. The last attempt wasn't that great
29/05/24, 23:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: No it won't. Cuz if u try to leave me if won't end well for u 🥰
29/05/24, 23:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hell na. Do uk how much money I can exploit from rich men?? I have 2 boobs and a pussy. Instant money
29/05/24, 23:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. U just didn't phrase it correctly. It's on u
29/05/24, 23:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Stop quoting me to me
29/05/24, 23:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Fortunately or unfortunately. No. Tell ur friend he/she has to wait
29/05/24, 23:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not exactly
29/05/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Prejudice is an opinion based on no real reason or actual experience.
29/05/24, 23:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: <Media omitted>
29/05/24, 23:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm waiting.
29/05/24, 23:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's always fun when ur friends trauma dump. Like yes tell me little one what is bothering you
29/05/24, 23:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: That I can agree on. I don't give a shit anymore. I just wanted to make my life easier by taking it
29/05/24, 23:49 - Ayush: are u gonna cheat on me with another bestfriend
29/05/24, 23:50 - Ayush: you do realise that mai khudse baate nai karta

29/05/24, 23:58 - Ayush: My friend is asking if diwali is in diwali this year?
29/05/24, 23:59 - Ayush: Shutup nerd you're wrong
29/05/24, 23:59 - Ayush: In the context of the definition of misogyny, prejudice is strong dislikeness towards women
30/05/24, 00:00 - Ayush: 😭😭 nothing as of now

30/05/24, 00:15 - Aaryaa Ranade: I already have a bestfriend. Ur the one I'm cheating with
30/05/24, 00:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh that's debatable. The texts go both ways. So what's the point in arguing
30/05/24, 00:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yayyy u cherish me 🥹🥹
30/05/24, 00:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm not gonna stop talking to u babe don't worry

30/05/24, 00:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: If u give me spoilers then I won't tell u when I reach the third season 🤷🏻‍♀️
30/05/24, 00:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah maybe. But if u do go broke. I have a way out. Instead of just selling a kidney
30/05/24, 00:23 - Ayush: U sent 20
30/05/24, 00:23 - Ayush: it's only fair
30/05/24, 00:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: Thats still poetic and there's no way that's gonna make me feel bad
30/05/24, 00:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Also not the family disappointment
30/05/24, 00:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yet
30/05/24, 00:24 - Ayush: I'm feeling this friendship is one sided
30/05/24, 00:24 - Ayush: Can't even send me 22 messages
30/05/24, 00:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ughh. Sometimes I feel like I did a hole for myself. Then I'm like nah. I'm iconic 💅🏻
30/05/24, 00:25 - Aaryaa Ranade: Diwali is when Diwali comes. We'll see. Why?
30/05/24, 00:25 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nerd just isnt an insult anymore
30/05/24, 00:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. Go Google it for all I care. It's not disliking them. It's believing they have a lesser role in society and should stick to it
30/05/24, 00:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: Are yar. Poorana fir. I mean tell me on ur own time. If u even want to.
30/05/24, 00:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not lazy. Designing ki padhai ki 😭😭

30/05/24, 00:33 - Ayush: if u don't reply I'll never come over
30/05/24, 00:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Maybe u are a better black mailer than me
30/05/24, 00:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yes. I won't. And I won't text u either. From any platform
30/05/24, 00:33 - Ayush: ofcourse and more emotionally intelligent
30/05/24, 00:33 - Ayush: nah I take that back

30/05/24, 00:34 - Ayush: proud teacher. I shall reply.
30/05/24, 00:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Stfu bitch
30/05/24, 00:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not really
30/05/24, 00:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Let's call it even. Or we'll just be going in circles all the time
30/05/24, 00:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: U better 🥰

30/05/24, 00:41 - Ayush: I DID NOT TELL YOU. I JUST TOLD U WHEN IT IS NOT WHAT IT IS
30/05/24, 00:42 - Ayush: are you really capable of breaking my heart for the second time?? I don't think so.
30/05/24, 00:42 - Ayush: I won't go broke. Mark my words.
30/05/24, 00:43 - Ayush: you're reduced down to a sad poem and it has no effect on you
30/05/24, 00:44 - Ayush: maybe you're just a black pebble on the side of the road
30/05/24, 00:44 - Ayush: 🤭🤭

01/06/24, 00:24 - Ayush: no I was talking about the straw, everything else was easy😛

01/06/24, 00:31 - Ayush: Oh I will. I'm just making you wait.
01/06/24, 00:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ofc. Extremely obvious. Anyone who doesn't understand is stupid

01/06/24, 00:54 - Ayush: yea and they care about their sexual health
01/06/24, 00:54 - Ayush: yea I can't even imagine what I would say to turtles
01/06/24, 00:55 - Ayush: No but it was 7 types of flavouring, every bite was a surprise
01/06/24, 00:55 - Ayush: For the first 7 bites
01/06/24, 00:55 - Ayush: It won't, can't hurt what's not there

01/06/24, 00:57 - Ayush: Always got you
01/06/24, 09:42 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly.
01/06/24, 09:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hainaa it is. But not paper straws those things disintegrate in like .3 secs
01/06/24, 09:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmfaoooo

01/06/24, 09:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: What? How? They're turtles
01/06/24, 09:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'd tell them to stop eating plastic to I can have my plastic straws back
01/06/24, 09:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: It wasn't 7 types of flavouring. It was 3. Do I know the flavours? No. But the colors? Pink, green, orange. U got thouroughly scammed.
01/06/24, 09:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's not my fault my phone was at 6 percent and then I was charging it while laying in bed and it was extremely comfy but also it would've died mid call if I would've talked
01/06/24, 09:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: How can I convey the wrong msg? They can read. Saw it for themselves
01/06/24, 11:49 - Ayush: good morning
01/06/24, 11:49 - Ayush: They're not that bad. It's not paper straws fault if u take 5 months to finish ur brink
01/06/24, 11:50 - Ayush: Ikr I love eminem
01/06/24, 11:50 - Ayush: Idk how but I'm sure they do
01/06/24, 11:51 - Ayush: Ohhh I'd I would organize a contest with different stages and as u progress through it you'll get be personal teenage mutant Ninja turtle
01/06/24, 11:52 - Ayush: nope pretty sure it tasted like 7 flavours. Has it occurred to you that I can try two flavours at once to create a third one?
01/06/24, 11:53 - Ayush: bahane mat de 😞
01/06/24, 11:53 - Ayush: No they can't read. How.
01/06/24, 12:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's more afternoon now but yes
01/06/24, 12:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't take that long to finish it 😭😭
01/06/24, 12:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: They're just weak
01/06/24, 12:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sounds like u have a fetish to watch turtles get it on
01/06/24, 12:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ooh sounds fun. A tiny turtle with a sword who's fighting. Adorable
01/06/24, 12:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'd take tons of pictures
01/06/24, 12:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's just weird. And doesn't blend well. Also it was barely a ribbon of flavour. It was mostly vanilla
01/06/24, 12:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: So u basically tastes vanilla
01/06/24, 12:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Watch me 💅🏻
01/06/24, 12:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yes they can. My boobs are intellectuals

01/06/24, 12:50 - Ayush: They're okay
01/06/24, 12:51 - Ayush: Not fetish but I'd love to watch. Why not
01/06/24, 12:51 - Ayush: Yea I'd make the tiny one fight the biggest one
01/06/24, 12:51 - Ayush: bro's gonna get obliterated
01/06/24, 12:52 - Ayush: No it's not weird. You're weird. I tasted more flavours than u did because I have good taste buds than u.
01/06/24, 12:53 - Ayush: vanilla is an empty canvas, u can taste whatever u put into it
01/06/24, 12:53 - Ayush: mai bhi dunga fir (:

01/06/24, 13:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah maybw
01/06/24, 13:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Speaking of which
01/06/24, 13:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: We should get vanilla milkshake and fries
01/06/24, 13:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Dip the first in the milkshake
01/06/24, 13:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. Doesn't work like that. I call dibs on bagane dena
01/06/24, 13:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope they have excellent eyesight
01/06/24, 13:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Plus it's not really their aesthetic

01/06/24, 14:18 - Ayush: I think the word youre looking for is curious
01/06/24, 14:18 - Ayush: I don't know it's fun
01/06/24, 14:18 - Ayush: Poor baby will not survive in this world if he's weak
01/06/24, 14:19 - Ayush: No you don't know what I tasted. If u eat yellow and green together it tastes like watermelon.
01/06/24, 14:19 - Ayush: you're obviously gonna deny it because u didn't try
01/06/24, 14:20 - Ayush: Yes we should.
01/06/24, 14:20 - Ayush: I wanted to do it for the longest time
01/06/24, 14:21 - Ayush: Why do you think that'll stop me😛
01/06/24, 14:21 - Ayush: I see, so if they see me they'll never forget me?
01/06/24, 14:22 - Ayush: I think they'll look good
01/06/24, 14:22 - Ayush: Is it a movie or like literally?
01/06/24, 14:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. U did text me at 11.49. still technically afternoon. Even if I had read it late
01/06/24, 14:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: We've never established that. U always want me to accept that
01/06/24, 14:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sure. If that's what u want
01/06/24, 14:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: But curiosity killed the cat
01/06/24, 14:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh fe
01/06/24, 14:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: I respect that
01/06/24, 14:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Spoken like a true serial killer
01/06/24, 14:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Poor baby did not want to be in the world where he was forced to fight
01/06/24, 14:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Should've made me taste it then
01/06/24, 14:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Noone was stopping you

01/06/24, 14:49 - Ayush: I was gatekeeping it

01/06/24, 22:23 - Ayush: Yea but would've ended badly once I would get to know about your bf
01/06/24, 22:24 - Ayush: Mash potatoes are bland
01/06/24, 22:24 - Ayush: maybe not for white washed taste buds
01/06/24, 22:24 - Ayush: But in general there are so many better dishes
01/06/24, 22:25 - Ayush: ☹️
01/06/24, 22:25 - Ayush: are u referring to your tits or literally?
01/06/24, 22:25 - Ayush: not just yours, thick thighs and boobs in general.
01/06/24, 22:26 - Ayush: I'll take ur word for it
01/06/24, 22:26 - Ayush: I don't remember saying that but I won't be surprised if I did
01/06/24, 22:27 - Ayush: and I guess yes. That was what I would've meant.
01/06/24, 22:27 - Ayush: Ohhh I will, one day. Just remind me like 40 times in the next 3 weeks

01/06/24, 23:04 - Ayush: however slim the chances might be
01/06/24, 23:04 - Ayush: Too bad i didn't hate you

03/06/24, 01:28 - Ayush: No mine gets worse overtime
03/06/24, 01:29 - Ayush: That's why I don't stalk myself. I end up removing a lot of shit
03/06/24, 01:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ur talking about it like ur 60

03/06/24, 01:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: U think I'm gonna fall for that??
03/06/24, 01:32 - Ayush: Yea that's why my main is empty
03/06/24, 01:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: U don't even have a main atp
03/06/24, 01:32 - Ayush: what genre
03/06/24, 01:33 - Ayush: cuz. u. get. played.
03/06/24, 01:33 - Ayush: I hoped ☹️
03/06/24, 01:33 - Ayush: a man can always try
03/06/24, 01:34 - Ayush: yea I'm just different like that
03/06/24, 01:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wise-y
03/06/24, 01:34 - Ayush: okay for starters
03/06/24, 01:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: U. Need. To. Stop. Calling. Me. Out.
03/06/24, 01:34 - Ayush: never stay friends with someone you had romantic feelings for
03/06/24, 01:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh poor thing. U need to try harder
03/06/24, 01:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Crazy
03/06/24, 01:35 - Ayush: i. Will. Not.
03/06/24, 01:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmao yes. I can attest to that. It never ends up well
03/06/24, 01:35 - Ayush: nah I give up
03/06/24, 01:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: But also u can't just kick them out of ur life.
03/06/24, 01:35 - Ayush: there's no other option
03/06/24, 01:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ouch :(
03/06/24, 01:36 - Ayush: tough love doesn't work either
03/06/24, 01:36 - Ayush: u can try pushing them away
03/06/24, 01:36 - Ayush: But after a point you'll just feel bad that u pushed them away
03/06/24, 01:37 - Ayush: And one incident is all that's gonna take to take u to square 1
03/06/24, 01:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah I suppose
03/06/24, 01:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's even worse when u find out the other person is playing u
03/06/24, 01:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Giving mixed signals
03/06/24, 01:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Then when u ask upfront they just say no
03/06/24, 01:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: Like stop fucking lying to me
03/06/24, 01:38 - Ayush: it's okay. don't play hard to get it doesn't work (;
03/06/24, 01:38 - Ayush: yeaa
03/06/24, 01:39 - Ayush: leading on is one of the worst form of torture
03/06/24, 01:39 - Ayush: In my teens I was led on for months
03/06/24, 01:39 - Ayush: until she woke up one day to simp on some other guy
03/06/24, 01:39 - Aaryaa Ranade: null
03/06/24, 01:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nah it works sometimes
03/06/24, 01:40 - Ayush: Faucet is on. Let's thud.
03/06/24, 01:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ouch yeah that's shit
03/06/24, 01:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: If u like me. Tell me. If u don't. Leave
03/06/24, 01:41 - Ayush: eh I guess but then it's toxic
03/06/24, 01:41 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo this guy said he "isn't ready for a relationship" but was ready to fuck. And recently poocha toh he said yeah he can consider dating
03/06/24, 01:41 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo. See my thistraps better
03/06/24, 01:42 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ig. But then the other person should but in efforts. If that's there then ur solif
03/06/24, 01:42 - Ayush: yea but homo sapiens in general are creatures that crave validation and when u know someone likes u back, you're going to go to that person
03/06/24, 01:42 - Ayush: UNTIL you eventually get bored of their validation and affection and find another one
03/06/24, 01:43 - Ayush: and the cycle repeats
03/06/24, 01:43 - Ayush: UNTIL u find someone whose validation doesn't 'bore' u and u confuse it with love <This message was edited>
03/06/24, 01:44 - Ayush: 🤣
03/06/24, 01:44 - Ayush: mine is worse
03/06/24, 01:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Confuse may not be the right word. More like crave their validation and somehow it's enough
03/06/24, 01:44 - Ayush: she said she cannot hurt the people she cares about and starts dating some guy
03/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: Validation yes. But also routine
03/06/24, 01:45 - Ayush: no I just wanted to say that
03/06/24, 01:45 - Ayush: I hope u got the reference
03/06/24, 01:45 - Ayush: no but you're making him put in the effort. Because consciously you know it's not needed.
03/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: What the fuck. That's messed up
03/06/24, 01:46 - Ayush: so you're testing him for absolutely nothing.
03/06/24, 01:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: B99?
03/06/24, 01:46 - Ayush: I guess
03/06/24, 01:47 - Ayush: uhhhuh I mean at some point even I would've done it
03/06/24, 01:47 - Ayush: The consequences wouldn't be so bad
03/06/24, 01:47 - Ayush: I know
03/06/24, 01:47 - Ayush: yea
03/06/24, 01:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: No. It's not exactly that. Sometimes it's just seeing if the other person genuinely cares
03/06/24, 01:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: They're not. Until u get ur heart broken
03/06/24, 01:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's painful
03/06/24, 01:48 - Ayush: there are other ways. making him think that u don't care about his efforts just so he puts in more, is not right in any way
03/06/24, 01:48 - Ayush: yes
03/06/24, 01:48 - Ayush: and I haven't learned my lesson because
03/06/24, 01:49 - Ayush: I sent the momos wala picture one a 3 person gc she was there
03/06/24, 01:49 - Ayush: And she said she was actually gonna come over today w a friend
03/06/24, 01:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay yeah I agree with that. U show that u acknowledge it. But also u need to see more if I wanna get into a relationship
03/06/24, 01:49 - Ayush: but wo friend ne cann diya that's why she couldnt
03/06/24, 01:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wtf. How? And why?
03/06/24, 01:50 - Ayush: yea it's fine when the guy knows that you're into him but you're just playing along, but it's really messed up if he doesn't
03/06/24, 01:50 - Ayush: Strict parents
03/06/24, 01:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: Uhuh. Fair
03/06/24, 01:51 - Ayush: chod the point being she's still my friend
03/06/24, 01:51 - Ayush: and not just friend
03/06/24, 01:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: How much of a friend.
03/06/24, 01:51 - Ayush: u can come to my place anytime friend
03/06/24, 01:51 - Ayush: which I am not proud of
03/06/24, 01:52 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no. Sometimes people don't understand. And then choose to give u mixed signals. Even after u make it obvious
03/06/24, 01:53 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh ouch. Yeah those friends don't end well. Experience.
03/06/24, 01:53 - Aaryaa Ranade: They think ur always gonna be there for them
03/06/24, 01:54 - Ayush: Oh yea ig, some of my friends are into playing hard to get chicks
03/06/24, 01:54 - Ayush: somehow it tricks them into thinking that if they bag them they're more precious
03/06/24, 01:55 - Ayush: Ahhh it's gonna end anyways, she might be going to Mumbai
03/06/24, 01:55 - Ayush: nah I don't think so
03/06/24, 01:55 - Ayush: I was never there for her neither was she <This message was edited>
03/06/24, 01:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh hell na. They're just attention  seekers. It's never gonna end well with those. U know that
03/06/24, 01:56 - Ayush: Ofcourse I do who's gonna tell them
03/06/24, 01:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Then if it's fine. I mean depends on the dynamic tbh
03/06/24, 01:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh. Well that puts. Lot of things u to perspective
03/06/24, 01:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah true
03/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: Ehh I like to not think about it
03/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: avoids most of the problems
03/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: there's this quote
03/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: we suffer more in imagination than in reality
03/06/24, 02:00 - Ayush: ye kya Chinese bolri hai
03/06/24, 02:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: U do sound like a philosopher now
03/06/24, 02:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: That always helps.
03/06/24, 02:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: Out of sight out of mind <This message was edited>
03/06/24, 02:03 - Ayush: I secretly am. Told you I'm 60.
03/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: now you know this side of me
03/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: that's the last you're gonna see of it
03/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: unless you call me while having a breakdown
03/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: yessir
03/06/24, 02:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo i might
03/06/24, 02:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: Have those a little too often
03/06/24, 02:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. We have a lot of late night convos. That side is gonna come out more
03/06/24, 02:10 - Ayush: you can. I won't mind at all.
03/06/24, 02:10 - Ayush: 🤭🤭 we love an emotionally unstable queen <This message was edited>
03/06/24, 02:11 - Ayush: no can we please stick to flirting
03/06/24, 02:11 - Ayush: opening up is disgusting
03/06/24, 02:11 - Ayush: respectfully

03/06/24, 02:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yassss exactly
03/06/24, 02:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Bro I'm not even kidding that's so true
03/06/24, 02:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Like I don't wanna tell u my deepest darkest fear
03/06/24, 02:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: U might judge me
03/06/24, 02:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: And then not like me
03/06/24, 02:13 - Ayush: sure
03/06/24, 02:14 - Ayush: I probably will
03/06/24, 02:14 - Ayush: I probably won't
03/06/24, 02:14 - Ayush: I just made opening up for you 10x more difficult
03/06/24, 02:14 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's just discouraging me from opening up to anyone
03/06/24, 02:14 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo exactly. Like it wasn't difficult to begin with
03/06/24, 02:14 - Ayush: okay atleast we're on the same oage

03/06/24, 02:15 - Ayush: it's okay to speak
03/06/24, 02:16 - Ayush: we don't have to know the deepest darkest fear
03/06/24, 02:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah I mean maybe. It just makes u vulnerable
03/06/24, 02:16 - Ayush: It does but being vulnerable is good
03/06/24, 02:16 - Ayush: among the right people
03/06/24, 02:16 - Ayush: I'm not saying I'm the right people but just in general
03/06/24, 02:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: I know. U don't have to explain
03/06/24, 02:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: And maybe it can be you
03/06/24, 02:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: And I'll be okay with that
03/06/24, 02:17 - Ayush: yea maybe
03/06/24, 02:17 - Ayush: it's past 2 am

04/06/24, 11:00 - Ayush: Ohhh

05/06/24, 11:42 - Ayush: It's not that difficult
05/06/24, 11:43 - Ayush: Tikhat, medium or goad
05/06/24, 11:43 - Ayush: yea u can never go wrong with ragda, in some places they also have ragda kachori

05/06/24, 12:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hainaa. Ragda in panipuri is better than batata.
05/06/24, 12:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: It just makes everything taste better
05/06/24, 12:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: Really. I've never had.
05/06/24, 12:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wait no. I have. It's delicious

05/06/24, 13:32 - Ayush: 😭😭 so do i
05/06/24, 13:33 - Ayush: then I think we can definitely do better than Pani puri
05/06/24, 13:33 - Ayush: 😛
05/06/24, 13:34 - Ayush: obviously u only add batata in Pani puri when there's a shortage of ragda in the entire universe
05/06/24, 13:34 - Ayush: Yessir
05/06/24, 13:34 - Ayush: Ik it's delicious

05/06/24, 13:35 - Ayush: 🔥 character development
05/06/24, 13:35 - Ayush: I used to eat goad too not because I can't handle the spice
05/06/24, 13:35 - Ayush: But because I liked the taste
05/06/24, 18:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: Haha nice
05/06/24, 18:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo yeah totally. But Pani Puri is delish toh
05/06/24, 18:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. Like I love batata. But panipuri mai it's just not okay. Makes it taste funny
05/06/24, 18:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: Perks of living in one place since bachpan

05/06/24, 19:50 - Ayush: disown, disband and abandon
05/06/24, 19:51 - Ayush: it's tastes okay in Pani puri but why settle for something that's just okay when there's something better

05/06/24, 21:13 - Ayush: end of discussion is a phrase used when the person wants to end an argument or a discussion concluding everything that he has to say
05/06/24, 21:14 - Ayush: yea
05/06/24, 21:14 - Ayush: It's a you problem

07/06/24, 01:03 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm like like with the Harry Potter movies too
07/06/24, 01:03 - Ayush: You're like like
07/06/24, 01:03 - Ayush: u can't convince me that's a typo
07/06/24, 01:04 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'll watch yjhd with like a grp of people. Alone ehh

07/06/24, 01:04 - Ayush: u mean MY shoulder to cry on
07/06/24, 01:04 - Aaryaa Ranade: Aaryaa has an extravagant personality. This is an incredibly minute detail that doesn't affect it that much
07/06/24, 01:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: Haww. But yeah. I suppose it can get boring
07/06/24, 01:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah we should
07/06/24, 01:05 - Ayush: ohh you're calling it extravagant
07/06/24, 01:05 - Ayush: and not unhinged and psychotic
07/06/24, 01:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm like that. I multitask. I don't read the texts again
07/06/24, 01:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: Huh. Yeah that's what I said no
07/06/24, 01:06 - Ayush: yes it does
07/06/24, 01:06 - Ayush: no my as in mine and not yours
07/06/24, 01:06 - Ayush: u said 'my' which means it's yours
07/06/24, 01:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: That is true. Ofc. But u need to hide that starting mai
07/06/24, 01:06 - Ayush: And not mine
07/06/24, 01:06 - Ayush: which doesn't make sense
07/06/24, 01:07 - Ayush: why would you cry and offer me a shoulder to cry on
07/06/24, 01:07 - Ayush: Maybe u should multitask typing and reading
07/06/24, 01:07 - Ayush: you're doing a bad job of hiding it
07/06/24, 01:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's the figure of speech. Ofc it means your shoulder dumbass
07/06/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh no. Whats the fun in that
07/06/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: I could just watch you and type at the same time
07/06/24, 01:08 - Ayush: pch tu apne dialogues pe focus karna
07/06/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Cuz it's you. Why would I try to hide from u
07/06/24, 01:08 - Ayush: I was gonna get to that later
07/06/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: 🙄🙄
07/06/24, 01:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Fine

07/06/24, 01:09 - Ayush: there is u should try it
07/06/24, 01:09 - Ayush: Gudgudi hoti hai
07/06/24, 01:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Meko gudgudi nahi hoti
07/06/24, 01:10 - Ayush: nope not how it works
07/06/24, 01:10 - Aaryaa Ranade: Too late. That's exactly what I'm gonna do
07/06/24, 01:10 - Ayush: Because I'll get creeped out and run away and never speak to you ever again
07/06/24, 01:11 - Ayush: Which btw is a very likely possibility backed with real experiences
07/06/24, 01:11 - Ayush: I'm talking about talking stage #2 and another chick on ig
07/06/24, 01:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh shit. Does that mean I should contain my personality around you
07/06/24, 01:12 - Ayush: And I'm the one that always talk about fucking?
07/06/24, 01:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oof. Guess she must be really unhinged
07/06/24, 01:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: That was the only possible thing u could've said atp
07/06/24, 01:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not my fault
07/06/24, 01:12 - Ayush: But if it's going to help in any way I wouldn't mind it
07/06/24, 01:13 - Ayush: chup
07/06/24, 01:13 - Ayush: Sabko hoti hai
07/06/24, 01:13 - Ayush: Just at different places
07/06/24, 01:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: See exactly my point. U were gonna say that
07/06/24, 01:13 - Ayush: I'm not ticklish on my gala but on my stomach yes
07/06/24, 01:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nahi hoti. U can check

07/06/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sure babe sure
07/06/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hehe 🤭

07/06/24, 01:16 - Ayush: respectfully
07/06/24, 01:16 - Aaryaa Ranade: Good thing tu nahi hai
07/06/24, 01:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: I would've slapped u back. Disrespectfully
07/06/24, 01:17 - Ayush: Okay it's safe to say you're not as bad as I thought
07/06/24, 01:17 - Ayush: no like on the first day of talking
07/06/24, 01:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wym bad as u thought. Tf
07/06/24, 01:17 - Ayush: she said that
07/06/24, 01:17 - Ayush: I'm in her to-do list
07/06/24, 01:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: Whaaaat? Crazy
07/06/24, 01:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Definitely starting off strong
07/06/24, 01:18 - Ayush: fking emo chick
07/06/24, 01:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: But also a woman who knows what she wants
07/06/24, 01:18 - Ayush: no I'm good
07/06/24, 01:18 - Ayush: Oh really fr?
07/06/24, 01:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Atleast she didn't say she wants to mix her blood with urs
07/06/24, 01:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah?
07/06/24, 01:18 - Ayush: yessir, i would've done the safe if u didn't carry pepper spray around
07/06/24, 01:19 - Ayush: not even close
07/06/24, 01:19 - Ayush: haa bach gayi
07/06/24, 01:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly why I carry pepper spray around. Might even get a pocket knife
07/06/24, 01:19 - Ayush: I'm sure I would've won but whatever
07/06/24, 01:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sure whatever
07/06/24, 01:19 - Ayush: tu mummy ke paas rote hue jaati
07/06/24, 01:20 - Ayush: <Media omitted>
07/06/24, 01:20 - Aaryaa Ranade: No u wouldn't have. I know how to fight
07/06/24, 01:20 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't cry
07/06/24, 01:20 - Ayush: I'm kidding you're great
07/06/24, 01:20 - Aaryaa Ranade: <Media omitted>
07/06/24, 01:20 - Aaryaa Ranade: Good. I better be
07/06/24, 01:20 - Ayush: that's starting off strong?!!??
07/06/24, 01:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: Kind of. Yes. I mean first convo?
07/06/24, 01:21 - Ayush: love how you're so positive about it
07/06/24, 01:21 - Ayush: yea no not that
07/06/24, 01:21 - Ayush: she was into murder mystery books
07/06/24, 01:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ofc. Girls supporting girls
07/06/24, 01:21 - Ayush: aw baby girl
07/06/24, 01:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: Haha lmao same. Maybe we should hookup
07/06/24, 01:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Extremely baby girl 🥲
07/06/24, 01:22 - Ayush: who hurt my pookie 🥺
07/06/24, 01:23 - Ayush: I know we haven't been friends for too long, technically we have but ykwim, i want you to know I'm there
07/06/24, 01:24 - Ayush: it may not seem like it because of my interesting personality
07/06/24, 01:24 - Ayush: but I genuinely do care
07/06/24, 01:24 - Ayush: Ayo stfu
07/06/24, 01:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Awww. Ur so adorable.
07/06/24, 01:25 - Aaryaa Ranade: I do too okay. So if u ever need to vent. Ya girl gotchu
07/06/24, 01:25 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay vent time
07/06/24, 01:26 - Ayush: yea I am not good at whining because I never had a need for it
07/06/24, 01:26 - Ayush: sure
07/06/24, 01:26 - Ayush: yea creepy for first convo
07/06/24, 01:26 - Ayush: And uska mansik santulan bhi thik nahi tha
07/06/24, 01:27 - Ayush: her therapist was ghosting her
07/06/24, 01:27 - Ayush: and she went bald once, a few months before we started talking
07/06/24, 01:27 - Ayush: Emotionally unstable girls supporting emotionally unstable girls
07/06/24, 01:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: <Media omitted>
07/06/24, 01:28 - Ayush: maybe u guys should I'm not gonna be the middle man
07/06/24, 01:28 - Ayush: 🥺🥺
07/06/24, 01:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: Stfu. Technically I haven't either considering I don't have a sibling but yeah
07/06/24, 01:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmfaoo. That's when uk it's bad bad. Also can't she technically not do that considering she's a therapist
07/06/24, 01:29 - Ayush: Yessir, idk if it's a bad thing but I suck at venting
07/06/24, 01:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ooh I've always wanted to. But idk my head shape is weird for that
07/06/24, 01:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. But we don't elaborate that much
07/06/24, 01:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh Jane de. Too much kasht
07/06/24, 01:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: Idk about bad exactly. But u should freely express ur thoughts. Who gives a shit what people think.
07/06/24, 01:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: I mean I don't toh u can always tell me
07/06/24, 01:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: And fuck people who judge.
07/06/24, 01:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: People in general are assholes
07/06/24, 01:33 - Ayush: ohh so basically the honeymoon phase is over unfortunately
07/06/24, 01:34 - Ayush: and it's normal okay to not speak as much as u did in the past
07/06/24, 01:35 - Ayush: and if he says that his mental health is not at it's best have u tried getting him to open up or something
07/06/24, 01:36 - Ayush: because when people tend to ask for space they might also mean that they want your attention and not in a bad way
07/06/24, 01:37 - Ayush: i mean the best u can do is try to get him to talk or leave him alone
07/06/24, 01:38 - Ayush: but not seem desperate for him to speak to you because it strikes male ego
07/06/24, 01:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no I have. I keep telling him that I'm here if he ever needs to talk. But he says it's smthnhw needs to deal with on his own. Which is fair.
07/06/24, 01:39 - Ayush: yea that's completely valid
07/06/24, 01:40 - Ayush: did something happen between you guys that makes him want to avoid you
07/06/24, 01:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: But then he says he'll start texting me more and shit. Toh why say that when uk u can't?
07/06/24, 01:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Idk. Not really?
07/06/24, 01:41 - Ayush: maybe it's because to keep the relationship lasting
07/06/24, 01:41 - Ayush: I mean how would you react if he says he's gonna text as much as he's doing rn
07/06/24, 01:41 - Ayush: you would be disappointed
07/06/24, 01:42 - Ayush: oh interesting
07/06/24, 01:42 - Ayush: I don't know him at all to speculate anything
07/06/24, 01:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: No ulta it's more realistic. Atleast ik what's going on with him
07/06/24, 01:43 - Ayush: no but it's a hypothetical scenario people don't react rationally
07/06/24, 01:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah I get it. Honestly idk what's going on
07/06/24, 01:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: He's avoiding his friends too
07/06/24, 01:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: But I'm not his friend. Fucking girlfriend
07/06/24, 01:44 - Ayush: maybe he's just stressed about admission and shi
07/06/24, 01:44 - Ayush: mommy issues? daddy issues??
07/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nah. Definitely not the person to do that
07/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: Pata nahi
07/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: And he won't tell me either
07/06/24, 01:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: What am I supposed to do
07/06/24, 01:48 - Ayush: acha
07/06/24, 01:48 - Ayush: hmm
07/06/24, 01:49 - Ayush: I think it's okay
07/06/24, 01:49 - Ayush: and not as bad as u think it is
07/06/24, 01:50 - Ayush: if you were going through something and didn't wanna talk about it to anyone, you would expect him to give you that space
07/06/24, 01:50 - Ayush: but also want him close at the same time
07/06/24, 01:51 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no I get it. I'm trying to give him space. But I'm also the kind of person who loves talking to u constantly especially if I like u
07/06/24, 01:51 - Ayush: yea that's fair
07/06/24, 01:52 - Ayush: But if he's genuinely suffering then you'll just come off as selfish
07/06/24, 01:52 - Ayush: but in my opinion you should continue if it's worth the compromise
07/06/24, 01:53 - Aaryaa Ranade: Idk. That's why I don't wanna say anything to him. Cuz I'm he's having a tough time.
07/06/24, 01:53 - Ayush: yea but it's difficult not to say anything to him
07/06/24, 01:54 - Aaryaa Ranade: But also. I'm going in a month. And I feel like if we can't talk rn. Then how will we manage anything when both of us are busy in clg in 2 different states
07/06/24, 01:54 - Ayush: I was literally gonna ask you
07/06/24, 01:54 - Ayush: have u guys had the 'convo'
07/06/24, 01:55 - Ayush: but I didn't wanna throw another bomb at the crash site
07/06/24, 01:55 - Aaryaa Ranade: It is. I genuinely love him. Happiest I've been in a long time. But lately it's just exhausting. Mainly cuz I just wanna talk. And he doesn't seem to have the time? I'll literally wait more than 2 hours to get like a 2 word reply
07/06/24, 01:55 - Aaryaa Ranade: And he's the only person I feel like talking to.
07/06/24, 01:56 - Aaryaa Ranade: Don't get me wrong i love talking to u and reply as soon as I see ur text. But different context uk
07/06/24, 01:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: No we have. And he did say we're gonna make it work. That nothings gonna change. We'll still talking like normal. And he's gonna be there.
07/06/24, 01:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: But idk how it's gonna work out
07/06/24, 01:58 - Ayush: yea but just loving him will only get you through so much of the way. There are other things. And if it's doing more harm than good then what's even the point of a relationship in the first place
07/06/24, 01:58 - Ayush: oww kinda hurtful that's okay
07/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: yea ik just wanted to say it anyways
07/06/24, 01:59 - Ayush: nobody really knows that
07/06/24, 02:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't wanna breakup. I mean funniest part is I've literally has this thought sm times that he's gonna break my heart. Cliche yes. But I still wanna be with him? And we don't just have problems. There's nice things too
07/06/24, 02:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: When we're hanging out we talk. About random things
07/06/24, 02:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: But yeah
07/06/24, 02:01 - Ayush: I'm not saying long distance is not worth giving a shot, but if u guys don't get ur shit together before u leave it's gonna make it infinitely times more difficult
07/06/24, 02:01 - Ayush: And even more exhausting
07/06/24, 02:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah considering it's u ik ud say that. Islie I send that pehle hi
07/06/24, 02:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. I don't know how to bring it up tho. It would mess up his mental health even more and I don't wanna be that person
07/06/24, 02:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: But we also do need to talk
07/06/24, 02:02 - Aaryaa Ranade: And if I say we don't talk enough he's say we hang out almost everyday. Text beech beech mai. What more do u want. And rn uk I haven't felt like replying to anyone
07/06/24, 02:02 - Aaryaa Ranade: How am I even supposed to counter that
07/06/24, 02:02 - Ayush: Ofcourse there are nice things and it's okay if the thought of a breakup scares the shit out of you. It is supposed to. But exactly a month later it's going to be a completely different scenario
07/06/24, 02:03 - Ayush: Mhm very normal
07/06/24, 02:03 - Ayush: u know me so well🫶
07/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: u guys need to because it's not a eenie weenie topic
07/06/24, 02:04 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah exactly. I know. And it's gonna be a drastic change. Not like a 2 he drive or smthn. That's why I wanna talk but
07/06/24, 02:04 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hainaa ik bbg 🥰
07/06/24, 02:04 - Ayush: maybe now is not the right time but trust me it gets harder overtime
07/06/24, 02:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah. My friends tell me that too.
07/06/24, 02:05 - Ayush: Why do u not feel like replying to anyone
07/06/24, 02:05 - Ayush: are u secretly in depression or something
07/06/24, 02:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: There might never be the right time. But what if talking makes everything worse?
07/06/24, 02:06 - Ayush: you make it sound like it's a debate competition when in reality it's two normal people talking about a sensitive topic
07/06/24, 02:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: Not me babe. I'm quoting him. That's what he would say
07/06/24, 02:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo no I'm not dw
07/06/24, 02:06 - Ayush: If talking is making everything worse, tell me what's the point of it all
07/06/24, 02:07 - Ayush: i hate that it's coming off as a tough talk
07/06/24, 02:07 - Ayush: But it's past 2am my filters are off
07/06/24, 02:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ur forgetting ur talking to someone who doesn't adress feelings period. Ik it's just communication but I need to talk about it without it seeming like I'm bringing up smthn stupid
07/06/24, 02:07 - Ayush: Acha
07/06/24, 02:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no. I appreciate that more
07/06/24, 02:07 - Ayush: 😮‍💨
07/06/24, 02:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Can't even say anything to that. We still haven't properly addressed his ex ko text thing
07/06/24, 02:08 - Ayush: yea step 1 the giggles gotta go
07/06/24, 02:08 - Ayush: I'm not saying prepare a speech or something
07/06/24, 02:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: The giggles forever invade me. But yeah

07/06/24, 02:10 - Ayush: and whatever you do there's a huge possibility you'll regret it later
07/06/24, 02:10 - Aaryaa Ranade: But the way he talked made it sound like this was actually gonna work for a long time.
07/06/24, 02:10 - Ayush: So you should do it anyways
07/06/24, 02:10 - Aaryaa Ranade: Now it seems like it might not. Or am I just pessimistic
07/06/24, 02:10 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah. Atleast I won't think I should've done that
07/06/24, 02:11 - Ayush: mhmm you're too scared to say something to him to which he'll overreact and leave u stranded
07/06/24, 02:11 - Ayush: abandonment issues I get it

11/06/24, 20:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: I have no fucking clue
11/06/24, 20:44 - Ayush: I'll come to you for free😤
11/06/24, 20:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: U can't even take pictures achhe se. Phone for jaega
11/06/24, 20:44 - Ayush: 👎🏼 Gori bhen ki lori
11/06/24, 20:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay meko chalega. I'm getting an ayush
11/06/24, 20:45 - Ayush: u never do. about anything.
11/06/24, 20:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: Stop being jealous 💋
11/06/24, 20:45 - Ayush: Phone kya hoga??
11/06/24, 20:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: I do. About a lot of things.
11/06/24, 20:45 - Ayush: Ofcourse teko chalega, it was never about you
11/06/24, 20:45 - Ayush: ayush will not
11/06/24, 20:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: Gir jaega. Aise 2 hands se nahi liya toh. But that makes the pictures look weird
11/06/24, 20:46 - Ayush: Sure
11/06/24, 20:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: What was it about then. U were the one who wanted to come to me for free
11/06/24, 20:46 - Ayush: Oh yea no ceiling mirror selfie is a crime to selfies in general
11/06/24, 20:46 - Aaryaa Ranade: Aaryaa kinda appreciates ayush's jealousy
11/06/24, 20:47 - Ayush: It was about me coming to u or not
11/06/24, 20:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ive taken them. They look weird. Then decided imma not do that again
11/06/24, 20:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Well I mean ceiling mirrors are cool. Just not in lifts.
11/06/24, 20:47 - Ayush: ayush does not appreciate aaryaa accepting ayush's jealousy
11/06/24, 20:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: And u were gonna. U always will
11/06/24, 20:48 - Ayush: good choice
11/06/24, 20:48 - Ayush: For the better
11/06/24, 20:48 - Ayush: ig. never made sense to me.
11/06/24, 20:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: Aaryaa is questioning why ayush doesn't appreciate aaryaa accepting his jealousy
11/06/24, 20:48 - Ayush: idk about the always part but sure
11/06/24, 20:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly
11/06/24, 20:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: In the bedroom???
11/06/24, 20:49 - Aaryaa Ranade: Shhh. If u wanna not accept it it's fine
11/06/24, 20:49 - Ayush: because aaryaa accepting ayush's jealousy is a very weird thing to do
11/06/24, 20:49 - Ayush: yea no. creepy.
11/06/24, 20:50 - Ayush: if that's what u want to hear I will say it for you
11/06/24, 20:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's is not weird. It is aaryaa acknowledging ayush ke feelings
11/06/24, 20:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: Uhhh. Not really. I mean when ur in the mood it could be a turn on uk
11/06/24, 20:50 - Aaryaa Ranade: U like saying things for me
11/06/24, 20:51 - Ayush: there is feelings and acknowledgement in the same sentence. How weird can it get
11/06/24, 20:52 - Ayush: like a guy would be on top of you and u could see hair popping out his butt crack and what not
11/06/24, 20:52 - Ayush: which you wouldn't see otherwise
11/06/24, 20:52 - Ayush: somehow that's turning you on. crazy.
11/06/24, 20:53 - Ayush: yea one can only know if they're true through lie detector
11/06/24, 20:53 - Ayush: because I myself have no idea
11/06/24, 22:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo yes agreed. Everything is weird atp just be unfazed
11/06/24, 22:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: What the actual fuck
11/06/24, 22:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why is that the first thing that popped in ur head
11/06/24, 22:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: Also magnified nahi hai to see his ass crack hair
11/06/24, 22:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Also how long is the hair to pop out of the crack 😭
11/06/24, 22:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nah. Everyone knows lie detectors are bs. They don't work. All they do is measure ur heart rate
11/06/24, 22:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Which u can easily control if ur just calm while lying
11/06/24, 22:48 - Ayush: I think I'm unfazed not because idgaf but I'm unfazed because theres nothing I can do to solve it
11/06/24, 22:49 - Ayush: my train of thoughts is beyond human comprehension
11/06/24, 22:49 - Ayush: yea no i don't think magnified lagta hai
11/06/24, 22:50 - Ayush: as long as u can watch it with ur naked eyes and the object is between the reflecting surface and infinity u should be good
11/06/24, 22:50 - Ayush: u never know the kind of gorillas they are from within
11/06/24, 22:52 - Ayush: No that's not true, lie detectors are not 100% infallible but they're almost impossible to beat <This message was edited>
11/06/24, 22:54 - Ayush: and it's not only the heart beat, it's many physiological parameters
11/06/24, 22:54 - Ayush: I made my chem project on this shi
11/06/24, 23:23 - Ayush: do u wanna call in some, might sleep early
11/06/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: If ur tired then it's okay. We can talk tomorrow too.

11/06/24, 23:35 - Ayush: yea on the verge of sleeping
11/06/24, 23:35 - Ayush: unless you want me half sleepy
11/06/24, 23:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: As much as id love that. I have a feeling u wouldn't understand what I'm saying
11/06/24, 23:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: Go sleep
11/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: yea I wouldn't
11/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: been skipping my gibberish lectures
11/06/24, 23:37 - Ayush: Goodnight
11/06/24, 23:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't talk gibberish 😭😭
11/06/24, 23:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Goodnight
11/06/24, 23:37 - Ayush: cute

11/06/24, 23:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: I will no dumbass
11/06/24, 23:38 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why would I noy
11/06/24, 23:42 - Ayush: 😡
11/06/24, 23:42 - Ayush: shutup
11/06/24, 23:42 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ruk
11/06/24, 23:42 - Aaryaa Ranade: Friend se I'm on call
11/06/24, 23:42 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ke sath
11/06/24, 23:45 - Ayush: not allowed
11/06/24, 23:45 - Ayush: you're cheating on me
11/06/24, 23:45 - Ayush: I know it
11/06/24, 23:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: Cheating??
11/06/24, 23:57 - Aaryaa Ranade: Hawww I would never
11/06/24, 23:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: That just sounds sad. Also smthn that an old man would say
11/06/24, 23:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yes clearly. Don't try to normalise it. That's just boring.
11/06/24, 23:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: And u also like being my daily dose of entertainment
12/06/24, 00:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ha yes okay physics. But if it is tiny then it might take some time to notice. Also why would I even look at his ass hair when I have other things to look at
12/06/24, 00:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: Also do u really think I'm gonna care about that at that point of time. I'm clearly gonna be preoccupied with smthn else
12/06/24, 00:01 - Aaryaa Ranade: 😭😭😭
12/06/24, 00:02 - Aaryaa Ranade: I wanna see ur project
12/06/24, 00:02 - Aaryaa Ranade: But also lie detectors aren't that reliable. They might help in a case. But chances are the person ur dealing with us a psychopath or mentally ill and genuinely believes what they're saying is the truth
12/06/24, 00:03 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's why detectives don't rely on them that much
12/06/24, 00:04 - Ayush: Stfu
12/06/24, 00:04 - Ayush: you would
12/06/24, 00:04 - Ayush: I'm an old man, not a sad old man tho
12/06/24, 00:05 - Ayush: me?? Normalise? I'll puke
12/06/24, 00:05 - Ayush: or I can say u like me being your daily dose of entertainment
12/06/24, 00:06 - Ayush: Exactly so I don't know why a ceiling mirror will make any sense in a room
12/06/24, 00:07 - Ayush: unless you're into bird's view masturbating angle or ass crack hair
12/06/24, 00:07 - Ayush: before u sy
12/06/24, 00:07 - Ayush: *Say
12/06/24, 00:07 - Ayush: Anything
12/06/24, 00:08 - Ayush: everything other than what I said is inadmissible and unjustified
12/06/24, 00:09 - Ayush: no but one look is all that's gonna take to unhorn u
12/06/24, 00:10 - Ayush: It's about forensic science but I talked about lie detectors cuz why not
12/06/24, 00:10 - Ayush: <Media omitted>
12/06/24, 00:11 - Ayush: Mid ass project
12/06/24, 00:13 - Ayush: yea girl we were arguing about my inability to comprehend my own feelings and emotions
12/06/24, 00:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: With who??
12/06/24, 00:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh that's up for debate.
12/06/24, 00:18 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. Plus extremely basic bitch behaviour
12/06/24, 00:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sure. U can say that. I'm not gonna deny it.
12/06/24, 00:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: And it makes u happy
12/06/24, 00:20 - Aaryaa Ranade: No not masterbating. More like sex.
12/06/24, 00:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: Have u seriously not heard about that?? Apparently it's very hot
12/06/24, 00:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nope. Definitely not.
12/06/24, 00:21 - Aaryaa Ranade: U bring up ass crack hair a lot. Are u sure that's not secretly your kink that ur trying to justify
12/06/24, 00:22 - Aaryaa Ranade: Sure. I'll try and lyk okay? Also how are u so sure about what will horn and unhorn me
12/06/24, 00:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: See that's interesting. That's a cool thing to do. I mean forensic science is interesting to begin with
12/06/24, 00:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: I would've screamed if I got that project
12/06/24, 00:23 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay wait lemme read

12/06/24, 00:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: But also how will I lie detector help you with that??!
12/06/24, 08:34 - Ayush: How would I know?
12/06/24, 08:35 - Ayush: Nope. Said it.
12/06/24, 08:35 - Ayush: yea very bbb
12/06/24, 08:36 - Ayush: 🤭🤭 u cannot deny it because it is true
12/06/24, 08:36 - Ayush: sure we'll go with that
12/06/24, 08:37 - Ayush: bol toh aise rahi hai jaise u fuck a lot of guys
12/06/24, 08:37 - Ayush: ceiling mirrors? I've heard ofc.
12/06/24, 08:38 - Ayush: scroll up and find the msg where I asked
12/06/24, 08:39 - Ayush: no ass crack hair is the most disgusting thing I could think of
12/06/24, 08:39 - Ayush: yea do what you need to do. I have intuitions. very strong intuitions.
12/06/24, 08:41 - Ayush: yea forensic science grew on me while watching CID
12/06/24, 08:41 - Ayush: I did too. In pain.
12/06/24, 08:41 - Ayush: Nope absolutely not
12/06/24, 08:43 - Ayush: Ofcourse you did. You don't even feel the need to read my messages properly ☹️
12/06/24, 08:44 - Ayush: What good is that going to do to anyone
12/06/24, 08:45 - Ayush: you're so lame
12/06/24, 08:46 - Ayush: you said I like saying things for you. I said idk if I do. Then I said we can only know if I like saying things for you through a lie detector
12/06/24, 08:47 - Ayush: next time steering back will not be gentle
12/06/24, 11:05 - Aaryaa Ranade: Idk ur supposed to
12/06/24, 11:06 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yes true. I mean I'm having fun so there's that
12/06/24, 11:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: "I don't fuck a lot of guys if that's what ur asking"
12/06/24, 11:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: No I meant the ceiling mirrors for sex thing
12/06/24, 11:07 - Aaryaa Ranade: 🙄🙄🙄
12/06/24, 11:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: There are worse things out there
12/06/24, 11:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: If it's so disgusting do u shave ur ass crack hair?? 🤨
12/06/24, 11:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: Itne strong intuitions. Enlighten me about them
12/06/24, 11:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ewww Cid is a kalank on crime shows.

12/06/24, 11:11 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ha so I was saying that like detectors aren't that reliable. U should prolly use some other method. But I mean it doesn't hurt to try
12/06/24, 11:12 - Aaryaa Ranade: <Media omitted>

14/06/24, 15:50 - Ayush: Yea no that tells me more than I need to know

14/06/24, 17:47 - Ayush: especially when she can't reach u so she stands on her toes
14/06/24, 17:47 - Ayush: and I can just wrap my arms around her waist

18/06/24, 23:26 - Ayush: that's literally every chainsmoker i know
18/06/24, 23:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: That sounds like a weird moan. Not the kind ud be into
18/06/24, 23:26 - Ayush: I don't vape. I have tried vape.
18/06/24, 23:26 - Aaryaa Ranade: 😭😭😭
18/06/24, 23:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: I won't promise

18/06/24, 23:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: The flavoured kind
18/06/24, 23:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: Watermelon
18/06/24, 23:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: The normal wala was so Ganda chi
18/06/24, 23:27 - Ayush: Watermelon flavoured cigarette?
18/06/24, 23:27 - Ayush: are u sure u didn't smoke jolly rancher or something
18/06/24, 23:27 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah. "Indie" I think
18/06/24, 23:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: Lmaoo yes I'm definitely sure since I breathed out smoke
18/06/24, 23:28 - Ayush: ohh
18/06/24, 23:28 - Ayush: I only know clove spice or something
18/06/24, 23:28 - Ayush: Right
18/06/24, 23:28 - Ayush: Did u inhale it?
18/06/24, 23:28 - Ayush: Or bas mouthed it
18/06/24, 23:28 - Aaryaa Ranade: Oh. That sounds like it'll taste spicy
18/06/24, 23:29 - Ayush: Idk haven't smoked
18/06/24, 23:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: <Media omitted>
18/06/24, 23:29 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ehh don't bother. It's stupid
18/06/24, 23:29 - Ayush: Did u
18/06/24, 23:30 - Ayush: get it into your lungs
18/06/24, 23:30 - Ayush: uhhuh
18/06/24, 23:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: How do u do that
18/06/24, 23:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: Like idts
18/06/24, 23:32 - Ayush: yea so u only basically tasted the flavour
18/06/24, 23:33 - Ayush: Didn't experience the effects
18/06/24, 23:33 - Ayush: so initially what happens is
18/06/24, 23:33 - Ayush: u inhale it and the smoke basically sits in your mouth
18/06/24, 23:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah exactly
18/06/24, 23:34 - Ayush: and then u need to take in the smoke to your lungs
18/06/24, 23:34 - Ayush: for the nicotine to work
18/06/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no. Just left it in my mouth
18/06/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: No side effects
18/06/24, 23:34 - Ayush: to put it simply u get what is called a 'hit'
18/06/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Maybe I could properly do it
18/06/24, 23:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: According to dhruv if u ever feel like it it should be with him noone else
18/06/24, 23:35 - Aaryaa Ranade: Makes sense since everyone else would get mad at me
18/06/24, 23:35 - Ayush: I mean I would be mad at you if u knew how to actually smoke🤡
18/06/24, 23:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: Okay but u tried vape before. So 🤷🏻‍♀️
18/06/24, 23:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: Once is fine no lekin?
18/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: I'll tell u what happens after u snoke
18/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: smoke
18/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: fair enough
18/06/24, 23:36 - Aaryaa Ranade: Ooh yes
18/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: I guess personally I won't
18/06/24, 23:36 - Ayush: so when u inhale, nicotine is passed in your blood
18/06/24, 23:37 - Ayush: nicotine is a mischievous substance
18/06/24, 23:37 - Ayush: it gives a person an illusion of pleasure
18/06/24, 23:37 - Ayush: momentarily.
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: so it increases the dopamine aka the happy hormone in our body
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: so we feel good when smoking
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: later in the day
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: when the dopamine levels come back to normal
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: your body wants to again experience that pleasure like before
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: so it starts craving nicotine again
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: where do u get it from??
18/06/24, 23:38 - Ayush: surprise
18/06/24, 23:39 - Ayush: cigarettes

18/06/24, 23:39 - Aaryaa Ranade: Cigs not sm. They taste bleh.
18/06/24, 23:40 - Ayush: yea but the thing with alcohol is, it is not mischievous
18/06/24, 23:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: The watermelon wala was nice. Tastes minty too kinda
18/06/24, 23:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Depends on how fast u get drunk
18/06/24, 23:40 - Ayush: it won't urge the body to crave it
18/06/24, 23:40 - Ayush: after getting normal
18/06/24, 23:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Nah to some people it might.
18/06/24, 23:40 - Aaryaa Ranade: Addictions babe

18/06/24, 23:41 - Ayush: and it gets worse overtime because of something known as nicotine resistance
18/06/24, 23:41 - Aaryaa Ranade: Cigs. Yeah. Smoking isn't cool
18/06/24, 23:42 - Ayush: if I had access to alcohol I'd drink that too

19/06/24, 00:04 - Ayush: You'll be judged on creativity, intricate details and the narration

21/06/24, 00:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: No I didnt say that. I just don't wanna go check what I meant. I've moved on from that topic
21/06/24, 00:47 - Ayush: But if u put me in a room with 10 women, I might get to know them better
21/06/24, 00:47 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah clearly. I mean we've established that.
21/06/24, 00:47 - Ayush: nah that just sounds cringe

27/06/24, 10:00 - Ayush: Okay bye
27/06/24, 10:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: I wouldn't have said it if it was cap
27/06/24, 10:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: I mean all those are basic things
27/06/24, 10:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why should I take care of my husband? He's a grown man. He can do that himself
27/06/24, 10:09 - Aaryaa Ranade: And my entire life isn't just my husband and my house. I have other things to do
27/06/24, 10:11 - Ayush: that's exactly why you would say

27/06/24, 10:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's right there next to the sink. Get it urself
27/06/24, 10:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: If I was a wife I'd "forget" his undies so I could see him nakey
27/06/24, 11:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm slamming the door and sighing in relief cuz he's finally gone and I can fuck my other hoe
27/06/24, 11:00 - Aaryaa Ranade: I'm gonna do it precisely because I shouldn't
27/06/24, 18:29 - Ayush: absolutely not

28/06/24, 00:17 - Ayush: exactly. koi bana hi nahi hoga that fits me.
28/06/24, 00:17 - Aaryaa Ranade: Good. She prolly doesn't want to be with a person who needs her to do that in the first place
28/06/24, 00:17 - Ayush: is it dhruv or gaurav's ex
28/06/24, 00:17 - Ayush: forgot her name
28/06/24, 00:18 - Ayush: shreya got it
28/06/24, 00:18 - Ayush: goldfish my ass
28/06/24, 00:18 - Ayush: concerned about your definition of 'win'
28/06/24, 00:18 - Ayush: there should exist a girl that would do that. If not I'll pay her.
28/06/24, 00:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: Who's gaurav 😭
28/06/24, 00:19 - Aaryaa Ranade: It's clearly not flawed

22/10/24, 09:32 - Ayush: I would say it's justified
22/10/24, 09:32 - Aaryaa Ranade: The point is he came when I didn't want too see him. It would've made such a big difference if he came here jury ke bad. When I actually needed to meet him

22/10/24, 09:46 - Ayush: Bhai you don't fucking ghost the person that you're gonna marry or something

22/10/24, 09:48 - Ayush: couldn't pay rent because of his mental health
22/10/24, 09:49 - Ayush: then you'll be expelled
22/10/24, 10:24 - Aaryaa Ranade: Exactly. And not even that. That was your "goal" your too dumb and young to even think about marriage rn. But why say it like that to gaslight me? Did you ask if that's what I want?

05/11/24, 22:28 - Ayush: not in the moment
05/11/24, 22:28 - Ayush: But before I came there, I was a bit
05/11/24, 22:29 - Ayush: I've been thinking about kissing in general
05/11/24, 22:29 - Ayush: I always thought like the first time is supposed to be all rainbows and unicorns
05/11/24, 22:29 - Ayush: in the rain, lightning in background type shit
05/11/24, 22:30 - Aaryaa Ranade: So what? You just saw me and then was like why not just kiss her

05/11/24, 22:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Wow. Okay great
05/11/24, 22:32 - Ayush: pch
05/11/24, 22:32 - Ayush: I didn't mean it literally
05/11/24, 22:33 - Ayush: 😭😭
05/11/24, 22:33 - Ayush: are we discussing emotions right now
05/11/24, 22:33 - Ayush: Because they are way beyond me
05/11/24, 22:33 - Ayush: and my comprehension
05/11/24, 22:33 - Aaryaa Ranade: Then how did you mean it?
05/11/24, 22:34 - Aaryaa Ranade: Well that just ends the entire discussion doesn't it
05/11/24, 22:35 - Ayush: like
05/11/24, 22:35 - Ayush: I took the hint?????
05/11/24, 22:35 - Ayush: I know it doesn't
05/11/24, 22:36 - Ayush: I'm really bad at reading emotions, my own and the others
05/11/24, 22:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: What hint ayush? When did I ever say anything today that made you feel that
05/11/24, 22:37 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah clearly
05/11/24, 22:39 - Aaryaa Ranade: I don't get it. So you've been thinking about kissing. And then you decided you wanted to kiss me. Based on this text here. And then you were like well first kiss doesn't really matter might as well kiss her
05/11/24, 22:40 - Ayush: Us standing close, you making eye contact??
05/11/24, 22:40 - Ayush: What the fuck
05/11/24, 22:41 - Aaryaa Ranade: That's what you're making it sound like
05/11/24, 22:41 - Ayush: By this I meant, we overthink a lot of things and picture something that's not real and these moments can be a little out of place instead of it being so perfect
05/11/24, 22:42 - Ayush: Were you not okay with anything that happened??
05/11/24, 22:42 - Ayush: I'm really sorry if it's making you feel that way
05/11/24, 22:43 - Aaryaa Ranade: Is that it? Honey I've known you since we were practically babies. Ofc I'll make eye contact with you
05/11/24, 22:44 - Aaryaa Ranade: Just tell me if you kissed me because you wanted to. Or because you thought that I wanted it
05/11/24, 22:45 - Ayush: ..
05/11/24, 22:45 - Aaryaa Ranade: If I wasn't i wouldn't have kissed you back
05/11/24, 22:46 - Ayush: yes that was it for me I don't know what to say
05/11/24, 22:46 - Ayush: Because I wanted to
05/11/24, 22:47 - Ayush: and I wouldn't have crossed this line if I wasn't sure that you were okay w it
05/11/24, 22:47 - Ayush: right
05/11/24, 22:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: No this isn't about you crossing a line
05/11/24, 22:48 - Aaryaa Ranade: Why?? Why did you feel like you wanted to kiss me? Am I just a friend? Is it smthn more what's going on?
05/11/24, 22:53 - Ayush: I wanna hear your side
05/11/24, 22:58 - Aaryaa Ranade: You kissed me out of the blue. Ik we flirt and stuff but I always thought it was a joke. Until today. Then I thought wait does he like me? And I kissed you back because I was thinking maybe I like him a little. I mean I did realise how terrible my ex was because of you. But hey that's probably just my emotions going all out of whack.
05/11/24, 22:59 - Aaryaa Ranade: But when you said yeah I mean you were just there to kiss?? Wow. That hurt. Because we're you just using me?
05/11/24, 23:05 - Ayush: obviously I wasn't there just for the kiss.
I had moments too where I was into you, today, before today.
05/11/24, 23:07 - Ayush: if you're thinking that I was using you, all the things we ever talked about means nothing to you??
05/11/24, 23:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: No it's not that. It's the way you just said yes. I felt bad. I know you won't use me idk. Because in that moment I didn't even know if you liked me or not
05/11/24, 23:08 - Aaryaa Ranade: But they were just moments
05/11/24, 23:09 - Ayush: that's what I was saying I'm literal ass talking about these things
05/11/24, 23:09 - Ayush: yea so what
05/11/24, 23:10 - Ayush: It's enough to tell you ki I just didn't kiss you because I wanted someone to kiss, I kissed you because I wanted to kiss you
05/11/24, 23:13 - Aaryaa Ranade: Does that mean you actually like me or not?
05/11/24, 23:15 - Aaryaa Ranade: Dude I had a crush on you in 7th grade. I like you a little now. Just tell me because then I can move on.
05/11/24, 23:15 - Aaryaa Ranade: I mean I obviously still wanna be friends with you. If you want that too
05/11/24, 23:26 - Ayush: it's gonna make me so sad and trust me when I say this not an inch of me wants to hurt you but long distance and I will never go together, I don't want to lead you on and I'm sorry if I unintentionally did
05/11/24, 23:28 - Ayush: yes bbg ofcourse I'm here for you, and I'm not saying it with a bad heart but pls take as much time as you need for yourself, nothing is going to affect whatever we have from my side
05/11/24, 23:31 - Aaryaa Ranade: Yeah no i knew that. About the long distance. I knew you won't do it. That's why I didn't see us dating.
